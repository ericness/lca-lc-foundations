I used sofrito and sazon to season the chicken and rice, which will give you the best arroz amarillo -- yellow rice. All you do is season the chicken, brown it, then toast the rice, and steam cook it in a skillet until it’s fluffy and ready to eat. In the end, you get beautiful crunchy rice much like you do in a chicken paella. This Arroz con Pollo is so comforting!

If you prefer a brothier soup that’s predominantly chicken and rice floating in broth, cook just until the rice is tender. (You can’t really overcook chicken thighs.) Lemon juice adds brightness, as does the lively mix of parsley, lemon, garlic and celery leaves strewn on top. In a large Dutch oven or pot, combine the broth, chicken, celery and rice. (Some broths have more salt than others, so start easy.) Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the rice starts to break down and lose its shape, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice a little at a time until the soup is bright but still tastes like chicken. (The soup, minus the lemon juice and parsley mixture, can be refrigerated for up to 3 days; the rice will absorb liquid as it sits, so add more chicken broth when reheating.\", \"score\": 0.99997246, \"raw_content\": null}, {\"url\": \"https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/231291/hearty-chicken-and-rice-soup/\", \"title\": \"Hearty Chicken and Rice Soup Recipe - Allrecipes\", \"content\": \"This flavorsome chicken and rice soup with veggies, fluffy rice, and tender chunks of chicken is ready in just over 30 minutes for a cozy\", \"score\": 0.99996233, \"raw_content\": null}, {\"url\": \"https://www.budgetbytes.com/creamy-chicken-rice-soup/\", \"title\": \"Creamy Chicken and Rice Soup - Budget Bytes\", \"content\": \"This Creamy Chicken and Rice Soup recipe is chock full of fresh vegetables, hearty wild rice, and a light but creamy broth.\", \"score\": 0.9999398, \"raw_content\": null}, {\"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zsTpGMUjIM\", \"title\": \"Amazing Chicken and Rice Soup Recipe | Caldo de Pollo con Arroz\", \"content\": \"Chicken and Rice Soup is one of the tastiest and easiest Chicken Soup recipes that you can make!
